This second assignment uses the ecore model form the first assignment to make an instance in the .xmi format. This instance is transformed to the html format using xtend. So xtend dependensies needs to be installed. It is also important to install validationDelegate and ACLValidationDelegate so all constraints in the ecore model are checked.
To execute the transformation the file HtmlGeneratorMain.java has to be run.
